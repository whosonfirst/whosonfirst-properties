### Adding a new property

1. Create a new property .json file using the [template file](properties_template.json).
2. Fill out all required properties and optional properties, if available.

### Properties

While a property .json file in the `whosonfirst-properties` repository does not require all properties listed below, the more information we are able to gather about a property, the better. When adding a new property, please provide as much current, available information about that specific property as possible.

* `"id":` A unique numeric integer identifier, typically derived from [Brooklyn Integers](https://www.brooklynintegers.com) (_integer, required property_).

* `"name":` The name of a given property. For example, the `qs:name` property would be `name` to represent the "name" property derived from "Quattroshapes" (_string, required property_). See also _Examples_ below.

* `"prefix":` The [source](https://www.github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-sources) that Who's On First derived this property from. For example, the `qs:name` property prefix would be `qs` to represent "Quattroshapes". This value is typically two to ten characters in length (_string, required property_) and must be unique (not shared with another source).

* `"description":` A one to two sentence description of the property value (_string, optional property_).

* `"type":` The property value type - `string`, `list`, `dictionary`, `float`, or `integer` (_string, required property_).

* `"items":` For properties with a `list` or `dictionary` `"type"`, the type of item contained within the `list` or `dictionary` (_string, optional property_).

* `"patterns":` A regular expression which can be used to validate the property's `name`, the property's _value_ or both. The `"patterns"` property is an object which can contain up to two key/value pairs; `patterns.name` validates the property's `name` and `patterns.value` validates the property's value. See also _Examples_ below.

### Examples

[`wof:country`](properties/wof/country.json)

```
{
    "id": 1158807947,
    "name": "country",
    "prefix": "wof",
    "description": "A two-letter country code from ISO 3166.",
    "type": "string",
    "patterns": {
        "value": "^[A-Z]{2}$"
    }
}
```

The `wof:country` property contains a ISO 3166 country code and the value of this property can be tested/validated against the regular expression in `patterns.value`.


[`name:preferred`](properties/name/preferred.json)

```
{
    "id": 1158804557,
    "name": "{lang}_x_preferred",
    "prefix": "name",
    "description": "The preferred name for a place. Used in Pelias and to generate language-specific map labels.",
    "type": "list",
    "items": {
        "type": "string"
    },
    "patterns": {
        "name": "*_x_preferred"
    }
}
```

Unlike other properties, the `name` of this property has language code wildcard, denoted by `{lang}` as part of the full name. The `name` can be tested and validated by building a regular expression formed from the `prefix` value and the `patterns.name` value, as in `^name:*_x_preferred$`.

The property value contains a `list` of one or more `string` elements.
