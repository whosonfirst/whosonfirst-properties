# lbl
Most properties listed below are derived from [Mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper).

## latitude
The coordinate that specifies a label's north–south position. Latitude is a decimal number between _-90.0_ and _90.0_.

## longitude
The coordinate that specifies a label's east-west position. Longitude is a decimal number between _-180.0_ and _180.0_.

## bbox
The `lbl:bbox` is the bounding box area used purely for map labelling and search purposes, and is usually smaller than the `geom:bbox`.

The `lbl:bbox` is human-generated (not derived from Mapshaper).
